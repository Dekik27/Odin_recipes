            <p><strong>Steps to make Chechebsa:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
                <li>Gradually add water to the flour mixture while whisking until you have a smooth batter with no streaks of flour remaining.</li>
                <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil.</li>
                <li>Pour a ladle-full (about 1/2 cup, 120 milliliters) of the batter into the hot pan, tilting the pan to form a thin, even circle.</li>
                <li>Cook the flatbread until lightly golden on the bottom and set on the top, which takes about 2-4 minutes. Then flip the bread and cook the other side until golden.</li>
                <li>Remove the cooked flatbread to a plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
                <li>While the flatbread is cooking, melt the Niter Kibbeh (spiced butter) in a small pot over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in the Berbere and continue to cook for a couple of minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Once the flatbread has cooled down a bit, tear it into bite-sized pieces and place them in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Pour the spiced butter mixture over the torn flatbread and use a fork to toss them together thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Serve the Chechebsa immediately with plain yogurt, a drizzle of honey, and scrambled eggs if desired.</li>
            </ul>
